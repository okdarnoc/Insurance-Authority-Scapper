The more RAM memory you have, the better it is, higher than 16 gigs of ram is best, maybe look at some cloud computer or some VPS.
For this you need Python 3.
In order to install it the needed libraries, run this command:
pip install -r requirements.txt
OR
pip3 instead of pip, that depends on your computer's installation.

then you just run python/python3 main.py
